Once upon a time there was a dragon, Susan Bringer of Death 
Every day it would fly around looking for the alien race, Tuls, to prevent their invasion
Until one day the Tuls invade and because of that Susan had to protect her turf, Scodelea
Because of that the the Tuls attack back – shoot out ensues 
Until finally one wins the battle – (ever since then) Scodelea is safe or Scodelea is taken over 
If the dragons win their lives continue as usual 
If the Tuls win the planet is doomed

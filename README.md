Once upon a time there was a dragon, Susan Bringer of Death. As part of her planet Scodelea’s armed forces, she would fly around every day looking for the threatening alien race, the Tuls, to prevent their invasion. Until one day the Tuls invade and because of that Susan had to protect her turf. A shoot out between aliens and dragons ensue until one is the victor. 
Tails – Susan Bringer of Death helps to defeat the Tuls. The dragons can continue to live on their planet in peace and without the threat of Tuls harm
Heads – The Tuls win. The planet is doomed, becoming a wasteland of car jackings, drag races, and drunken fist fights.
